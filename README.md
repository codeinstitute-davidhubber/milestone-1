## Summary



This Milestone project creation is the culmination of learning and study from the first three modules of the Full Stack Developer Course, HTML, CSS & User Centric Frontend Development, to build a mobile-first fully responsive website for, in this instance, a music band.

The premise of the site is to allow music fans & potential music fans of The Monkees to, potentially, learn a little about the band's history and it's members.

----------

## User Stories
* As a user, I want the ability to read about the band and band members.
* As a user, I want the ability to hear audio/ music clips from the band's most popular music.
* As a user, I want the ability to watch the band in action to guage their showmanship.
* As a user, I want the ability to contact the band to talk about hiring for events.
* As a user, I want the ability to view the bands profiles on mine or a selection of social media platforms.

## UX

The site was kept simple and colourful with simple collapsible, responsive navigation.

The idea was not to attempt to 'fill a gap' of unknown knowledge about 'The Monkees', but rather, 'paraphrase’, (massively), their story.

With just a few images and short descriptions of the members of the band, the hope was to allow users/ viewers of the site simple and quick navigation.

The audio on the site is limited, and each song, when played, shows the album from which it came, with a link to a 'Wikipedia' page about the song itself.

A video was added more for curiosity rather than necessity, and a picture gallery of The Monkees discography was place at the end of the site.

A contact form was added before the footer with dates and locations of there next gigs.

The site is a scrolling site rather than a site full of pages, merely to allow the user to stay on one page without losing track.

## Testing

##### User Testing

All pages functions and information was reviewed by a small team. 

All anchor points & links/ nav links are functional, have been tested and are live. They also, if required, open in a different tab, (```
target="_blank"```
), to ensure undue disruption to the flow of the page. 


The issue causing the most problems was the main cartoon image of the the band. Trying to get the image to shrink and center across various devices was taxing. It was resolved by using a 'transform' function with 'translate:

```
position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%;
-webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
```

Contact section added, although, no functionality at this time.
